CSE 150 Lab Descriptions - Python

Lab 1 - Mininet
  Used python scripts to run mininet and connect 4 hosts to a switch.
  Wrote a shell script to print all even lines of any file.

Lab 2 - HTTPS, DNS, and TCP
  Analyzed HTTP, DNS, and TCP protocols, packets, codes, requests, 
  responses, and connections using wireshark and mininet.

Lab 3 - Firewall using OpenFlow
  Created a simple firewall using OpenFlow-enabled switches. 
  Used a python scripted Mininet configuration to setup my
  network, and created the firewall in a POX controller.

Lab 4 Final Project - Router
  Created a Mininet Topology and Pox controller with the following features:
  - All hosts are able to communicate, EXCEPT:
  - Untrusted Host cannot send ICMP and IP traffic to Host 101-104, 201-204,
    or the LLM Server.
  - Trusted Host cannot send IP and ICMP traffic to Host 201-204 in Department B,
    or the LLM Server.
  - Hosts in Department A (Host 101-104) cannot send any ICMP traffic to the hosts
    in Department B (Host 201-204), and vice versa.
