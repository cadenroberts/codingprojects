ECE 103 Lab descriptions - MATLAB

Lab 1 - Introduction to MATLAB
  Defined, graphed, and computed functions over certain intervals.

Lab 2 - Visualizing Signal in MATLAB
  Plotted multiple signal functions and computer energies and frequencies.

Lab 3 - Convolutions and Impulse Responses
  Plotted convolutions of functions and derived impulse responses of differentials
  of an RLC circuit and an Industrial Shock Absorber.

Lab 4 - Fourier Series
  Wrote a function to calculate Fourier coefficients. Plotted spectrum, reconstructed
  time domain signals, and real and imaginary parts of functions.

Lab 5 - Fourier Transform and Inverse Fourier Transform
  Plotted IFT of frequency domain signals, and real and imaginary parts of the function.
  Plotted magnitude and phase using convolution theorem. Calculated energy using
  Parseval's theorem.

Lab 6 - ECG Signals, Modulation and Demodulation
  Plotted phase and magnitude response of functions. Used FT and IFT. Calculated
  energy of signals in frequency domain using Parseval's theorem. Plotted magnitude of
  transmitted signal in frequency domain, time domain transmitted signal, and time domain
  demodulated and low-pass filtered output signal and corresponding frequency domain spectrum.
