CSE 107 Lab Descripitions - C++

Lab 1
  Alice and Bob have 2𝑛 + 1 coins, each with probability of a head equal to 1/2.
  Bob tosses 𝑛 + 1 coins, while Alice tosses the remaining n coins. Assuming
  independent coin tosses, show that the probability that after all the coins have been
  tossed, Bob will have gotten more heads than Alice is 1/2.

Lab 2
  An urn contains 𝑎 azure balls and 𝑐 carmine balls, where 𝑎 > 0 and 𝑐 > 0. Balls
  are selected from the urn at random and discarded, until the first time a selected ball
  has a color different from its predecessor. That ball is then replaced, and the
  procedure is restarted. (Observe that each iteration of this procedure results in at
  least one ball being discarded.) The process continues until the last ball is
  discarded. Show that this last ball is equally likely to be azure or carmine.

Lab 3
  Joe Lucky plays the lottery on any given week with probability 𝑝, independently of whether
  he played on any other week. Each time he plays, he has a probability 𝑞 of winning, again
  independently of everything else. During a fixed time period of 𝑛 weeks, let 𝑋 be the number
  of weeks that he played the lottery and 𝑌 be the number of weeks that he won.

Lab 4
  Suppose you have two coins for which 𝑃(Coin 1 = heads) = 𝑝 and 𝑃(Coin 2 = heads) = 𝑞.
  Flip Coin 1 until the first head appears, counting the number of flips. Let 𝑁 be the number of flips in
  this first sequence. Next, perform 𝑁 flips of Coin 2, counting the number of heads. Let 𝑌 be the number
  of heads in this second sequence. Note that 𝑁 is Geometric with parameter 𝑝. If 𝑋𝑖 is the random variable
  𝑋𝑖 = { 1 if the 𝑖th flip of Coin 2 is heads, 0 if the 𝑖th flip of Coin 2 is tails } then we see each 𝑋𝑖
  is Bernoulli with parameter 𝑞. We assume of course that all coin flips are independent, so the set
  {𝑁, 𝑋1, 𝑋2, … } is independent. Observe that 𝑌 = 𝑋1 + 𝑋2 + ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ + 𝑋𝑁 is the sum of a random number of
  independent identically distributed (iid) random variables. We will derive the mean and variance of 𝑌,
  in terms of 𝑝 and 𝑞, in lecture. Your goal in this assignment will be to compute both 𝐸[𝑌] and Var(𝑌)
  experimentally, for various values of 𝑝 and 𝑞. Each approximate mean and variance you compute in this
  project will be obtained by performing 10,000 trials of the above experiment.

Lab 5
  In this project you will construct the CDF of a random variable 𝑍 = 𝑌1 + 𝑌2, where both 𝑌1 and 𝑌2 are
  exponential random variables with parameter 𝜆 = 1. You will present your CDF as a table similar in
  form to the Standard Normal CDF table posted on the class webpage. We will show in lecture that 𝑍
  has a well-known distribution called the Erlang distribution. Here you will construct your CDF by
  performing 20,000 trials of the following simple experiment. Obtain samples 𝑌1 and 𝑌2 of the
  exponential distribution, then compute the sum 𝑍 = 𝑌1 + 𝑌2. Using these trials, compute the relative
  frequencies of the events {𝑍 ≤ 𝑧} for all 𝑧 ∈ {0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, … …, 9.7, 9.8, 9.9}, which are 100
  equally spaced points in the range 0.0 to 9.9, at distance 0.1 apart.
