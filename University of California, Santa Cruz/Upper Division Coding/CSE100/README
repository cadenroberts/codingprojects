CSE 100 Lab Descriptions - Verilog

Lab 1 - 7 Segment Display
  Implemented a 7 Segment Display Decoder in Verilog.
  Wrote a decoder that displayed a 4-bit hex nibble onto the on-board 7-Segment Display.
  Programmed my implementation to a Basys 3 FPGA Board.

Lab 2 - Arithmatic Logic Unit
  Implemented an Arithmetic Logic Unit, capable of doing addition, subtraction,
  square root, and base 2 logarithms.
  Programmed my implementation to a Basys 3 FPGA Board.

Lab 3 - Screensaver
  Implemented a VGA interface with a counter built from adders and flip-flops, and
  displayed the contents of a ROM over VGA.
  Programmed my implementation to a Basys 3 FPGA Board.

Lab 4 - Stop It
  Implemented a state machine as part of a sequential circuit for a game called 'Stop It'.
  Programmed my implementation to a Basys 3 FPGA Board.

Lab 5 - Dino Run
  Implemented a state machine and connected several modules as part of a game called 'Dino Run'.
  Programmed my implementation to a Basys 3 FPGA Board.
