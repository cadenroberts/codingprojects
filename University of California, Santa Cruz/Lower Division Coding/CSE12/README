CSE 12 Lab Descriptions - Digital / RISC-V

Lab 1 - Intro to Logic Stimulation
  Created truth tables from logic expressions in Digital using logic gate circuits,
  SOP, and POS. Used logic reduction on large expressions. Created truth tables from
  NMOS/PMOS transistor circuits.

Lab 2 - Higher Order Logic
  Built an ALU that could perform bitwise left rotation in digital. Created
  a logic circuit to illuminate 2 7 segment leds according to a 4 bit binary
  input. Created a 4 register data path for the ALU.

Lab 3 - Looping with RISC-V Assembly
  Created a RISC-V program that could print a right triangle of asterisks to
  the console with a height determined from user input.

Lab 4 - Merging Sorted Linked Lists
  Created a linked list in RISC-V and defined functions to insert and sort
  a linked list and to merge 2 sorted lists.
