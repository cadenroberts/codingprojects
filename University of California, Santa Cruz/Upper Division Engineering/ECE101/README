ECE 101 Lab Descriptions

Lab 1 - Fundamental Circuit Theory Laws
  I verified KVL and KCL using nodal analysis equations and
  by measuring voltage, current and power for multiple resistors
  in a set circuit.

Lab 2 - Fundamental Circuit Theory Theorems
  Experimented to verify Thevenin's and Norton's theorems, as
  well as the Max Power Transfer theorem.

Lab 3 - Single Time Constant Circuits
  Investigated transient voltage and current for single time
  constant circuits involving capacitors and inductors.

Lab 4 - Sinusoidal Steady State Filters
  Investigated the frequency domain characteristics of steady
  state linear wave filters. Measured amplitude and phase reponses
  and correlated them with the underlying theory.
